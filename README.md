# launchbar-unicode

LaunchBar action to insert Unicode characters.


The file `categories_to_json.py` reads the file `Categories.txt` (from https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn36/) and creates a JSON version of the information, which is then used by the action.


The mapping from LaTeX to Unicode was based on data available from https://github.com/joom/latex-unicoder.vim/.
